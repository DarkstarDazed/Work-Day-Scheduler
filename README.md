# 3rd-Party-APIs_Work-Day-Scheduler_hw5

## Description:
For this project we were tasked with taking starter code and making a functioning work day scheduler.  I started by making the basic time blocks with save buttons before moving on to linking the css styles and adding styling classes with bootstrap. My next move was adding a function that would check the current time and link that time to pre made stylings in the css for past, present, and future workday tasks. From there I used moment.js to grab and display the current time on the app and added functionality to the save buttons, allowing them to read saved information from local storage and display that info on page refresh.
